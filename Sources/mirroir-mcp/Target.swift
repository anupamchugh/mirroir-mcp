/// Composite describing everything needed to automate one target (iPhone Mirroring
/// window, a native macOS app, a simulator, etc.).
///
/// A `Target` is built by composing:
/// - a `WindowBridging` (how to locate the window, activate it, detect state)
/// - an `InputProviding` (how to tap, swipe, type — CGEvent-based today)
/// - a `ScreenCapturing` + `ScreenDescribing` (how to see and interpret the window)
/// - a `Backtracking` (how to navigate one screen back)
/// - an `AppLifecycleHandling` (how to launch and force-quit the app)
/// - a `TargetProfile` (pure metadata driving behavioral decisions)
///
/// Call sites that previously branched on `ctx.targetType == "iphone-mirroring"`
/// should query `target.profile.X` (a specific capability bit) instead.
