/// The shape mirrors a physical trackpad flick as captured from a real
/// device trace: while the finger is in contact the per-frame deltas ramp
/// up linearly to a peak velocity (gesture phase Began/Changed), and after
/// the finger lifts a momentum tail continues at that peak velocity and
/// decays geometrically (momentum phase flags). Most of a flick's
/// displacement — roughly 70% — travels in the momentum tail; iOS reads
/// those momentum semantics as a native flick, so paging surfaces (feeds,
/// carousels) snap to the next page exactly as they do for a finger flick.
///
/// Swipes slower than the flick threshold are deliberate drag-scrolls:
/// the finger stops before lifting, so all displacement is delivered by
/// evenly spaced drag frames and no momentum follows.
///
/// Total displacement is conserved exactly: the drag and momentum deltas
/// of a plan always sum to the amplified pixel distance, so scroll
/// calibration that estimates content offset from swipe distance behaves
/// identically whether or not a momentum tail is emitted.
